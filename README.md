In computational imaging, like microscopy, reconstructing a 3D scene from incomplete 2D measurements is essential but challenging due to insufficient data. Instead of direct inversion, an optimization approach is used to find sparse and non-negative solutions efficiently. Traditional methods are too slow for large-scale tasks, so the process is optimized in Fourier space and simplified with auxiliary variables. The ADMM algorithm effectively breaks the problem into manageable parts. Additionally, I have explored how the NeuroMANCER library handles inverse problems that involve non-smooth regularizers.
